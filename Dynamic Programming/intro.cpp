/*
    Dynamic Programming : Enhanced recursion
    How to check if any problem will be solved by DP
    1.  We would be given choice if to include or not
    2.  Only one function call : no DP, When two calls then consider
    3.  Minimum, Maximum would be asked

    First write the recursive function than memoize that and than top down

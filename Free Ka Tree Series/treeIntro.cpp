/*
    Types of Binary trees
    1. Full Binary Tree : every node can have either 0 or 2 children
    2. Complete Binary Trees : 
        a) All levels are completely filled except the last level
        b) the last level has all nodes on left as possible
    3. Perfect Binary Tree : All leaf nodes are at same level
    4. Balanced Binary Tree : height should be at max log(N), here N is number of nodes
    5. Degenerate Tree : either left squed or right squed tree ( Just like Linked List )

    Traversal Techniques : ( BFS / DFS )
    1. DFS techniques : 
        a) Inorder Traversal ( left, root, right)
        b) Postorder Traversal ( left, right, root)
        c) Preorder Traversal ( root, left, right)
    2. BFS technique :
        a) Level Order Traversal
